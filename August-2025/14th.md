# August 14th Problems

## Problem 1: Least Larger

**Task:**

Given an array of numbers and an index, return either the index of the smallest number that is larger than the element at the given index, or -1 if there is no such index (or, where applicable, Nothing or a similarly empty value).

**Notes:**

- Multiple correct answers may be possible. In this case, return any one of them.
- The given index will be inside the given array.
- The given array will, therefore, never be empty.

**Examples:**

```
least_larger([4, 1, 3, 5, 6], 0) → 3
Explanation: Element at index 0 is 4. The smallest number larger than 4 is 5 (at index 3)
```

```
least_larger([4, 1, 3, 5, 6], 4) → -1
Explanation: Element at index 4 is 6. There is no number larger than 6 in the array
```

## Problem 2: Histogram Data

**Task:**

You will be given an array of non-negative integers and positive integer bin width. Your task is to create the Histogram method that will return histogram data corresponding to the input array. The histogram data is an array that stores under index i the count of numbers that belong to bin i.

**Rules:**

- The first bin always starts with zero.
- On empty input you should return empty output.

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**
```
Input: data = [1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 6], binWidth = 1
Output: [1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Explanation: 
- Bin 0 (0-0): 1 element (0)
- Bin 1 (1-1): 3 elements (1, 1, 1)
- Bin 2 (2-2): 1 element (2)
- Bin 3 (3-3): 1 element (3)
- Bin 4 (4-4): 0 elements
- Bin 5 (5-5): 0 elements
- Bin 6 (6-6): 1 element (6)
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: data = [1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 6], binWidth = 2
Output: [4, 2, 0, 1]
Explanation:
- Bin 0 (0-1): 4 elements (0, 1, 1, 1)
- Bin 1 (2-3): 2 elements (2, 3)
- Bin 2 (4-5): 0 elements
- Bin 3 (6-7): 1 element (6)
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: data = [7], binWidth = 1
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
```

## Problem 3: Find the Divisors!

**Description:**

Create a function named `divisors` that takes an integer `n > 1` and returns an array with all of the integer's divisors (except for 1 and the number itself), from smallest to largest. If the number is prime return the string `'(integer) is prime'` (null in C#, empty table in COBOL).

**Examples:**

```
divisors(12) → [2, 3, 4, 6]
Explanation: 12 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6 (excluding 1 and 12)
```

```
divisors(25) → [5]
Explanation: 25 is divisible by 5 (excluding 1 and 25)
```

```
divisors(13) → "13 is prime"
Explanation: 13 has no divisors except 1 and itself
```

## Problem 4: Take a Number And Sum Its Digits Raised To The Consecutive Powers (Eureka!)

**Description:**

The number 89 is the first integer with more than one digit that fulfills the property: the sum of its digits raised to consecutive powers equals the number itself.

```
89 = 8¹ + 9²
135 = 1¹ + 3² + 5³
```

**Task:**

We need a function to collect these numbers, that may receive two integers `a`, `b` that defines the range `[a, b]` (inclusive) and outputs a list of the sorted numbers in the range that fulfills the property described above.

**Examples:**

```
Input: 1, 10
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Explanation: Single digit numbers satisfy the property (n = n¹)
```

```
Input: 1, 100
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89]
Explanation: 89 = 8¹ + 9² = 8 + 81 = 89
```

```
Input: 90, 100
Output: []
Explanation: No numbers in this range satisfy the property
```
