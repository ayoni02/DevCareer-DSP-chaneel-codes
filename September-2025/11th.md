## Problem 1: The Vowel Code

**Step 1: Encode Function**

Create a function called `encode()` to replace all the lowercase vowels in a given string with numbers according to the following pattern:

```
a -> 1
e -> 2
i -> 3
o -> 4
u -> 5
```

**Example:**
```
encode("hello") → "h2ll4"
```

**Note:** There is no need to worry about uppercase vowels in this kata.

**Step 2: Decode Function**

Create a function called `decode()` to turn the numbers back into vowels according to the same pattern shown above.

**Example:**
```
decode("h3 th2r2") → "hi there"
```

**Note:** For the sake of simplicity, you can assume that any numbers passed into the function will correspond to vowels.

## Problem 2: Divide and Conquer

**Description:**

Given a mixed array of number and string representations of integers, add up the non-string integers and subtract the total of the string integers. Return as a number.

**Examples:**

```
div_con(['3', 6, 6, 0, '5', 8, 5, '6', 2, '0']) → 13
Explanation: (6 + 6 + 0 + 8 + 5 + 2) - (3 + 5 + 6 + 0) = 27 - 14 = 13
```

```
div_con([9, 3, '7', '3']) → 2
Explanation: (9 + 3) - (7 + 3) = 12 - 10 = 2
```

**Sample Solution:**
```python
def div_con(num):
    return sum(x for x in num if type(x) == int) - sum(int(x) for x in num if type(x) == str)
```

## Problem 3: Find Nearest Square Number

**Description:**

Your task is to find the nearest square number of a positive integer `n`. 

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

**Rules:**
- Find the perfect square closest to `n`
- If `n` is already a perfect square (e.g. `n = 144`, `n = 81`), return `n`

**Example:**
```
n = 111
Output: 121
Explanation: 111 is closer to 121 (square of 11) than to 100 (square of 10)
```

**Good luck!**

## Problem 4: +1 Array

**Description:**

Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value represented by the array.

If the array is invalid (empty, or contains negative integers or integers with more than 1 digit), return `nil` (or your language's equivalent).

**Valid Arrays - Examples:**

```
[4, 3, 2, 5] → [4, 3, 2, 6]
Explanation: 4325 + 1 = 4326
```

```
[1, 2, 3, 9] → [1, 2, 4, 0]
Explanation: 1239 + 1 = 1240
```

```
[9, 9, 9, 9] → [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: 9999 + 1 = 10000
```

```
[0, 1, 3, 7] → [0, 1, 3, 8]
Explanation: 0137 + 1 = 0138
```

**Invalid Arrays - Examples:**

```
[] → nil
Reason: Empty array
```

```
[1, -9] → nil
Reason: -9 is not a non-negative integer
```

```
[1, 2, 33] → nil
Reason: 33 is not a single-digit integer
```
