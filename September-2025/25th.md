# September 25th Problems

## Problem 1: Compare Within Margin

**Description:**

Create a function `close_compare` that accepts 3 parameters: `a`, `b`, and an optional `margin`. The function should return whether `a` is lower than, close to, or higher than `b`.

**Rules:**

- When `a` is close to `b`, return `0`
  - `a` is considered "close to" `b` if `margin` is greater than or equal to the absolute distance between `a` and `b`
- When `a` is less than `b`, return `-1`
- When `a` is greater than `b`, return `1`
- If `margin` is not given, treat it as if it were zero
- Assume: `margin >= 0`

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**
```
Input: a = 3, b = 5, margin = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: a and b are no more than 3 numbers apart (|3-5| = 2 ≤ 3)
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: a = 3, b = 5, margin = 0
Output: -1
Explanation: The distance between a and b is greater than 0, and a is less than b
```

## Problem 2: Add Digits (258)

**Description:**

Given an integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: 
38 → 3 + 8 → 11
11 → 1 + 1 → 2
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 0
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= num <= 2³¹ - 1`

## Problem 3: Sum of Digits of String After Convert (1945)

**Description:**

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer `k`. Your task is to convert the string into an integer by a special process, and then transform it by summing its digits repeatedly `k` times.

**Steps:**

1. **Convert** `s` into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e. replace `'a'` with `1`, `'b'` with `2`, ..., `'z'` with `26`)
2. **Transform** the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits
3. **Repeat** the transform operation (step 2) `k` times in total

**Process Example:**

If `s = "zbax"` and `k = 2`:
1. Convert: `"zbax"` ➝ `"(26)(2)(1)(24)"` ➝ `"262124"` ➝ `262124`
2. Transform #1: `262124` ➝ `2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4` ➝ `17`
3. Transform #2: `17` ➝ `1 + 7` ➝ `8`

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "iiii", k = 1
Output: 36
Explanation:
- Convert: "iiii" ➝ "(9)(9)(9)(9)" ➝ "9999" ➝ 9999
- Transform #1: 9999 ➝ 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 ➝ 36
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation:
- Convert: "leetcode" ➝ "(12)(5)(5)(20)(3)(15)(4)(5)" ➝ "12552031545" ➝ 12552031545
- Transform #1: 12552031545 ➝ 1 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 5 ➝ 33
- Transform #2: 33 ➝ 3 + 3 ➝ 6
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "zbax", k = 2
Output: 8
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `1 <= k <= 10`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters

## Problem 4: Pythagorean Triple

**Description:**

Given an unsorted array of 3 positive integers `[n1, n2, n3]`, determine if it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using those 3 integers.

A Pythagorean Triple consists of arranging 3 integers, such that:

```
a² + b² = c²
```

**Examples:**

```
[5, 3, 4] → True
Explanation: 3² + 4² = 5² (9 + 16 = 25)
```

```
[3, 4, 5] → True
Explanation: 3² + 4² = 5² (9 + 16 = 25)
```

```
[13, 12, 5] → True
Explanation: 5² + 12² = 13² (25 + 144 = 169)
```

```
[100, 3, 999] → False
Explanation: No matter how you arrange them, you cannot satisfy a² + b² = c²
```

**Return Values:**
- For Python: return `True` or `False`
