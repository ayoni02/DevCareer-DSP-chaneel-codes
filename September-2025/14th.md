## Problem 3: Group Even and Odd Indexed Characters

**Description:**

Given a string `s`, your task is to return another string such that even-indexed and odd-indexed characters of `s` are grouped and the groups are space-separated. Even-indexed group comes first, followed by a space, and then by the odd-indexed part.

**Example:**

```
Input: "CodeWars"
Output: "CdWr oeas"

Breakdown:
         C o d e W a r s
indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Even indices (0, 2, 4, 6): "CdWr"
Odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7): "oeas"

Final output: "CdWr oeas"
```

**Notes:**
- Tested strings are at least 8 characters long
