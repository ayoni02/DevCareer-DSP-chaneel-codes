# Daily Coding Challenges

## Challenge 1: Is the String Uppercase?

**Task:**
Create a method to see whether the string is ALL CAPS.

**Examples (input -> output):**
```
"c" -> False
"C" -> True
"hello I AM DONALD" -> False
"HELLO I AM DONALD" -> True
"ACSKLDFJSgSKLDFJSKLDFJ" -> False
"ACSKLDFJSGSKLDFJSKLDFJ" -> True
```

**Note:**
In this Kata, a string is said to be in ALL CAPS whenever it does not contain any lowercase letter so any string containing no letters at all is trivially considered to be in ALL CAPS.

## Challenge 2: Sum of Differences

**Description:**
Your task is to sum the differences between consecutive pairs in the array in descending order.

**Example:**
```
[2, 1, 10]  -->  9
```

In descending order: `[10, 2, 1]`

Sum: `(10 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 8 + 1 = 9`

If the array is empty or the array has only one element the result should be 0.

## Challenge 3: Increment String

**Description:**
Your job is to write a function which increments a string, to create a new string.

- If the string already ends with a number, the number should be incremented by 1.
- If the string does not end with a number, the number 1 should be appended to the new string.

**Examples:**
```
foo -> foo1
foobar23 -> foobar24
foo0042 -> foo0043
foo9 -> foo10
foo099 -> foo100
```

**Attention:** If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered.

## Challenge 4: Largest Pair Sum

**Description:**
Given a sequence of numbers, find the largest pair sum in the sequence.

**Examples:**
```
[10, 14, 2, 23, 19] -->  42 (= 23 + 19)
[99, 2, 2, 23, 19]  --> 122 (= 99 + 23)
```

**Note:**
Input sequence contains minimum two elements and every element is an integer.
