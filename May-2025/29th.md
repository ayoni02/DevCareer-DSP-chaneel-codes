# May 29th Coding Challenges

## Challenge 1: Reverse String II (LeetCode 541)

**Description:**
Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

- If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them.
- If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- s consists of only lowercase English letters
- `1 <= k <= 104`

### Solution 1:
```python
def reverseStr(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    s = list(s)
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2 * k):
        s[i:i + k] = reversed(s[i:i + k])
    return ''.join(s)

# Example test cases
print(reverseStr("abcdefg", 2))  # Output: "bacdfeg"
print(reverseStr("abcd", 2))     # Output: "bacd"
```

### Solution 2:
```python
def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
    res = ""
    pl = True
    for i in range(0, len(s), k):
        if pl == True:
            res += s[i:i+k][::-1]
            pl = False
        else:
            res += s[i:i+k]
            pl = True
    return res

print(reverseStr("abcdefg", 2))  # Output: "bacdfeg"
```

## Challenge 2: Find the Mean (Average)

**Instructions:**
Find the mean (average) of a list of numbers in an array.

To find the mean (average) of a set of numbers add all of the numbers together and divide by the number of values in the list.

**For an example list of 1, 3, 5, 7:**

1. Add all of the numbers
   ```
   1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
   ```

2. Divide by the number of values in the list. In this example there are 4 numbers in the list.
   ```
   16/4 = 4
   ```

3. The mean (or average) of this list is 4

### Solution:
```python
def mean(lst):
    return sum(lst)/len(lst)

print(mean([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 2
```

## Challenge 3: N×N Multiplication Table

**Description:**
Your task is to create N×N multiplication table, of size provided in parameter.

**Example:**
When given size is 3:
```
[[1,2,3],[2,4,6],[3,6,9]]

1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
```

If you get an input of 5, your function should return:
```
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 
 [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], 
 [3, 6, 9, 12, 15], 
 [4, 8, 12, 16, 20], 
 [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]]
```

### Solution:
```python
def multiplication_table(size):
    res = []
    for i in range(1, size+1):
        pl = list(range(i, (i*size)+1, i))
        res.append(pl)
    return res

print(multiplication_table(1))  # [[1]]
print(multiplication_table(2))  # [[1, 2], [2, 4]]
print(multiplication_table(3))  # [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]]
print(multiplication_table(4))  # [[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6, 8], [3, 6, 9, 12], [4, 8, 12, 16]]
print(multiplication_table(5))  # [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], [3, 6, 9, 12, 15], [4, 8, 12, 16, 20], [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]]
```

## Challenge 4: Conditional Function Call

**Description:**
Create a function called `_if` which takes 3 arguments: a value `bool` and 2 functions (which do not take any parameters): `func1` and `func2`.

When `bool` is truthy, `func1` should be called, otherwise call the `func2`.

**Example:**
```python
def truthy():
    print("True")

def falsey():
    print("False")

_if(True, truthy, falsey)
# prints 'True' to the console
```

## Challenge 5: Predict Age

**Description:**
My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret! In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

**Steps:**
- Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
- Multiply each number by itself.
- Add them all together.
- Take the square root of the result.
- Divide by two.

**Example:**
```
predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) == 86
```

**Note:** 
- You have 8 great-grandparents
- The result should be rounded down to the nearest integer

### Solution:
```python
def predict_age(age_1, age_2, age_3, age_4, age_5, age_6, age_7, age_8):
    pl1 = ((age_1**2 + age_2**2 + age_3**2 + age_4**2 + age_5**2 + age_6**2 + age_7**2 + age_8**2)**0.5)/2
    return int(pl1)

print(predict_age(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45))  # Output: 86
```

## Challenge 6: Highest Value of Consonant Substrings

**Description:**
Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except `"aeiou"`.

We shall assign the following values: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26`.

**Example 1:**
For the word "zodiacs", let's cross out the vowels. We get:
```
"z o d i a c s"
     ↓
"zodiac" -> 26
```

The consonant substrings are: `"z"`, `"d"` and `"c"` with values:
- `"z"` = 26
- `"d"` = 4
- `"c"` = 3

The highest is **26**.

**Example 2:**
```
"strength" -> 57
```

The consonant substrings are: `"str"` and `"ngth"` with values:
- `"str"` = 19 + 20 + 18 = 57
- `"ngth"` = 14 + 7 + 20 + 8 = 49

The highest is **57**.
