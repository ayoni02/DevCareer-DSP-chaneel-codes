# May 22nd Coding Challenges

## Challenge 1: Capital Letters Indices

**Instructions:**
Write a function (`capitals`) that takes a single non-empty string of only lowercase and uppercase ascii letters (`word`) as its argument, and returns an ordered list containing the indices of all capital (uppercase) letters in the string.

**Example (Input --> Output):**
```
"CodEWaRs" --> [0,3,4,6]
```

## Challenge 2: Summation

**Description:**
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num (both inclusive). The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. Your function only needs to return the result, what is shown between parentheses in the example below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, see the sample tests.

**Examples (Input -> Output):**
```
2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)
```

## Challenge 3: Find Next Perfect Square

**Description:**
You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the `findNextSquare` method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the argument is itself not a perfect square then return either `-1` or an empty value like `None` or `null`, depending on your language. You may assume the argument is non-negative.

**Examples (Input --> Output):**
```
121 --> 144
625 --> 676
114 --> -1  # because 114 is not a perfect square
```

## Challenge 4: Accumulate String

**Description:**
This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function `accum`:

**Examples:**
```
accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
```

The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from `a..z` and `A..Z`.
