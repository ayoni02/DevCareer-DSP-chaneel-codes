# Thursday Coding Challenges

## Challenge 1: A Strange Trip to the Market

### Story
You're on your way to the market when you hear beautiful music coming from a nearby street performer. The notes come together like you wouldn't believe as the musician puts together patterns of tunes. As you wonder what kind of algorithm you could use to shift octaves by 8 pitches or something silly like that, it dawns on you that you have been watching the musician for some 10 odd minutes. You ask, "how much do people normally tip for something like this?" The artist looks up. "It's always gonna be about tree fiddy."

It was then that you realize the musician was a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era! The Loch Ness Monster almost tricked you!

### Task
There are only 2 guaranteed ways to tell if you are speaking to The Loch Ness Monster:
- A) it is a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era
- B) it will ask you for tree fiddy

Since Nessie is a master of disguise, the only way accurately tell is to look for the phrase `"tree fiddy"`. Since you are tired of being grifted by this monster, the time has come to code a solution for finding The Loch Ness Monster.

Note that the phrase can also be written as `"3.50"` or `"three fifty"`.

Your function should return true if you're talking with The Loch Ness Monster, false otherwise.

## Challenge 2: Count the Digit

### Description
Take an integer `n (n >= 0)` and a digit `d (0 <= d <= 9)` as an integer.

Square all numbers `k (0 <= k <= n)` between 0 and n. Count the numbers of digits `d` used in the writing of all the `k**2`.

Implement the function taking `n` and `d` as parameters and returning this count.

### Examples
```
n = 10, d = 1
the k*k are 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
We are using the digit 1 in: 1, 16, 81, 100. The total count is then 4.

The function, when given n = 25 and d = 1 as argument, should return 11 since
the k*k that contain the digit 1 are:
1, 16, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 361, 441.
So there are 11 digits 1 for the squares of numbers between 0 and 25.
```

Note that `121` has twice the digit 1.

## Challenge 3: Sum of Triangular Numbers

### Description
Your task is to return the sum of Triangular Numbers up-to-and-including the nth Triangular Number.

**Triangular Number:** "any of the series of numbers `(1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc.)` obtained by continued summation of the natural numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.`"

```
[01]
02 [03]
04 05 [06]
07 08 09 [10]
11 12 13 14 [15]
16 17 18 19 20 [21]
```

**Example:**
```
If 4 is given: 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 20
```

Triangular Numbers cannot be negative so return 0 if a negative number is given.

## Challenge 4: Form The Minimum

### Description
Given a list of digits, return the smallest number that could be formed from these digits, using the digits only once (ignore duplicates).

Only positive integers in the range of 1 to 9 will be passed to the function.

### Examples
```
[1, 3, 1] ==> 13
[5, 7, 5, 9, 7] ==> 579
[1, 9, 3, 1, 7, 4, 6, 6, 7] ==> 134679
```
