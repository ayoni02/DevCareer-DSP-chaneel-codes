# July Coding Challenges

## Challenge 1: Filter Out Odd Numbers

Write a small function that returns the values of an array that are not odd.

All values in the array will be integers. Return the good values in the order they are given.

**Example:**
```
no_odds([0, 1]) --> [0]
```

---

## Challenge 2: Switch A and B

Given a string made up of letters a, b, and/or c, switch the position of letters a and b (change a to b and vice versa). Leave any incidence of c untouched.

**Examples:**
```
'acb' --> 'bca'
'aabacbaa' --> 'bbabcabb'
```

## Challenge 3: Remainder of Division

### Task
Write a function that accepts two integers and returns the remainder of dividing the larger value by the smaller value.

Division by zero should return an empty value.

**Examples:**
```
n = 17
m = 5
result = 2 (remainder of 17 / 5)

n = 13
m = 72
result = 7 (remainder of 72 / 13)

n = 0
m = -1
result = 0 (remainder of 0 / -1)

n = 0
m = 1
result - division by zero should return None
```

## Challenge 4: Maximum Length Difference

You are given two arrays `a1` and `a2` of strings. Each string is composed with letters from `a` to `z`. Let `x` be any string in the first array and `y` be any string in the second array.

**Find max(abs(length(x) − length(y)))**

If `a1` and/or `a2` are empty return `-1` in each language except in Haskell (F#) where you will return `Nothing` (None).

**Example:**
```
a1 = ["hoqq", "bbllkw", "oox", "ejjuyyy", "plmiis", "xxxzgpsssa", "xxwwkktt", "znnnnfqknaz", "qqquuhii", "dvvvwz"]
a2 = ["cccooommaaqqoxii", "gggqaffhhh", "tttoowwwmmww"]

maxdiflg(a1, a2) --> 13
```
