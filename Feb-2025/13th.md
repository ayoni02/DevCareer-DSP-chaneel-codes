## Question 1: Car Rental Pricing

After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

**Solution provided:**

def rentals(d):
    return d*40 - (d>2)*20 - (d>6)*30
```

## Question 2: String Number Filter

Your boss decided to save money by purchasing some cut-rate optical character recognition software for scanning in the text of old novels to your database. At first it seems to capture words okay, but you quickly notice that it throws in a lot of numbers at random places in the text.

**Examples (input → output)**
- `'! !'` → `'! !'`
- `'123456789'` → `''`
- `'This looks5 grea8t!'` → `'This looks great!'`

Your harried co-workers are looking to you for a solution to take this garbled text and remove all of the numbers. Your program will take in a string and clean out all numeric characters, and return a string with spacing and special characters `~#$%^&!@*():;"'.,?` all intact.

**Solution provided:**
```python
def filter_num(s):
    num = "0123456789"
    res = ""
    for i in s:
        if i in num:
            continue
        res += i
    return res
```
