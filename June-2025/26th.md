# June 26th Coding Challenges

## Challenge 1: Reverse Words in String

**Description:**
Complete the solution so that it reverses all of the words within the string passed in. Words are separated by exactly one space and there are no leading or trailing spaces.

**Example (Input --> Output):**
```
"The greatest victory is that which requires no battle" --> "battle no requires which that is victory greatest The"
```

**Good luck!**

## Challenge 2: Sum of Sequence

**Description:**
Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of a sequence of integers. The sequence is defined by 3 non-negative values: begin, end, step.

If begin value is greater than the end, your function should return 0. If end is not the result of an integer number of steps, then don't add it to the sum. See the 4th example below.

**Examples:**
```
2,2,2 --> 2
2,6,2 --> 12 (2 + 4 + 6)
1,5,1 --> 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)
1,5,3 --> 5 (1 + 4)
```

## Challenge 3: Longest Consecutive Strings

**Description:**
You are given an array (list) strarr of strings and an integer k. Your task is to return the first longest string consisting of k consecutive strings taken in the array.

**Examples:**
```
strarr = ["tree", "foling", "trashy", "blue", "abcdef", "uvwxyz"], k = 2
```

Concatenate the consecutive strings of strarr by 2, we get:

```
treefoling   (length 10)  concatenation of strarr[0] and strarr[1]
folingtrashy (length 12)  concatenation of strarr[1] and strarr[2]
trashyblue   (length 10)  concatenation of strarr[2] and strarr[3]
blueabcdef   (length 10)  concatenation of strarr[3] and strarr[4]
abcdefuvwxyz (length 12)  concatenation of strarr[4] and strarr[5]
```

Two strings are the longest: "folingtrashy" and "abcdefuvwxyz".
The first that came is "folingtrashy" so 
`longest_consec(strarr, 2)` should return `"folingtrashy"`.

**In the same way:**
```
longest_consec(["zone", "abigail", "theta", "form", "libe", "zas", "theta", "abigail"], 2) --> "abigailtheta"
```

**Note:**
- n being the length of the string array, if n = 0 or k > n or k <= 0 return "" (return Nothing in Elm, "nothing" in Erlang).
- Consecutive strings: follow one after another without an interruption
