# June 19th Challenge Questions

## Question 1: Remove Exclamation Mark

**Description:**
Remove an exclamation mark from the end of a string. For a beginner kata, you can assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.

**Examples:**
```
"Hi!"     ---> "Hi"
"Hi!!!"   ---> "Hi!!"
"!Hi"     ---> "!Hi"
"!Hi!"    ---> "!Hi"
"Hi! Hi!" ---> "Hi! Hi"
"Hi"      ---> "Hi"
```

**Sample Solution:**
```python
def remove(s):
    return s[:-1] if s and (s[-1] == "!") else s

print(remove("samII!"))  # Output: "samII"
print(remove(""))        # Output: ""
```

## Question 4: Mexican Wave

**Introduction:**
The wave (known as the Mexican wave in the English-speaking world outside North America) is an example of metachronal rhythm achieved in a packed stadium when successive groups of spectators briefly stand, yell, and raise their arms. Immediately upon stretching to full height, the spectator returns to the usual seated position.

**Task:**
In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave. You will be passed a string and you must return an array of strings where an uppercase letter is a person standing up.

**Rules:**
1. The input string will always consist of lowercase letters and spaces, but may be empty, in which case you must return an empty array.
2. If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat.

**Examples:**
```
"hello" => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]

" s p a c e s " => [" S p a c e s ", " s P a c e s ", " s p A c e s ", 
                    " s p a C e s ", " s p a c E s ", " s p a c e S "]
```
