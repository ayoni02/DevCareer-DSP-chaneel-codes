## Challenge 1: Reverse String II (LeetCode 541)

**Description:**
Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

- If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them.
- If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- s consists of only lowercase English letters
- `1 <= k <= 104`

### Solution 1:
```python
def reverseStr(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    s = list(s)
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2 * k):
        s[i:i + k] = reversed(s[i:i + k])
    return ''.join(s)

# Example test cases
print(reverseStr("abcdefg", 2))  # Output: "bacdfeg"
print(reverseStr("abcd", 2))     # Output: "bacd"
```

### Solution 2:
```python
def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
    res = ""
    pl = True
    for i in range(0, len(s), k):
        if pl == True:
            res += s[i:i+k][::-1]
            pl = False
        else:
            res += s[i:i+k]
            pl = True
    return res

print(reverseStr("abcdefg", 2))  # Output: "bacdfeg"
```

## Challenge 2: Find the Mean (Average)

**Instructions:**
Find the mean (average) of a list of numbers in an array.

To find the mean (average) of a set of numbers add all of the numbers together and divide by the number of values in the list.

**For an example list of 1, 3, 5, 7:**

1. Add all of the numbers
   ```
   1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
   ```

2. Divide by the number of values in the list. In this example there are 4 numbers in the list.
   ```
   16/4 = 4
   ```

3. The mean (or average) of this list is 4

### Solution:
```python
def mean(lst):
    return sum(lst)/len(lst)

print(mean([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 2
```
