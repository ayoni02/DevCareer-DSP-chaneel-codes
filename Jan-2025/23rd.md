# Jan 23rd Questions Set

## Question 1: Additive Inverse

Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

**Examples:**
- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` → `[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]`
- `[1, -2, 3, -4, 5]` → `[-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]`
- `[]` → `[]`

**Notes:**
- You can assume that all values are integers
- Do not mutate the input array

## Question 2: Capitalize Alternate Indexes

Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

**Example:**
```
capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']
```

**Notes:**
- The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces
- Good luck!

## Question 3: First 5 Exponents

Given a number, return the first 5 exponents of the number (the square number will give its first exponent).

**Example:**
```
Exponent(5) → [25, 625, 390625, 152587890625, 23283064365386962890625]
```

**Pattern:**
```
[X^2 → (X^2)^2 → ((X^2)^2)^2 ...]
```

## Question 4: Expressions Matter

### Description
Given three integers a, b, and c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the operators +, *, and parentheses (). In other words, try every combination of a, b, and c with the operators, without reordering the operands, and return the maximum value.

### Example
With the numbers 1, 2, and 3, here are some possible expressions:
- `1 * (2 + 3) = 5`
- `1 * 2 * 3 = 6`
- `1 + 2 * 3 = 7`
- `(1 + 2) * 3 = 9`

**The maximum value that can be obtained is 9**

### Notes
- The numbers are always positive, in the range 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10
- You can use the same operation more than once
- It is not necessary to use all the operators or parentheses
- You cannot swap the operands. For example, with the given numbers, you cannot get the expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8

### Input and Output Examples
- `expressionsMatter(1, 2, 3)` → `9`, because `(1 + 2) * 3 = 9`
- `expressionsMatter(1, 1, 1)` → `3`, because `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
- `expressionsMatter(9, 1, 1)` → `18`, because `9 * (1 + 1) = 18`
