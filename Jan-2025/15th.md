# Jan 15th Coding Questions

## Question 1: Sort Array

Finish the solution so that it sorts the passed in array of numbers. If the function passes in an empty array or null/nil value then it should return an empty array.

**Examples:**
```python
solution([1,2,3,10,5]) # should return [1,2,3,5,10]
solution(None) # should return []
```

## Question 2: Multiplication Table

Your goal is to return multiplication table for number that is always an integer from 1 to 10.

**Example:**

For example, a multiplication table (string) for number == 5 looks like below:

```
1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
4 * 5 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
6 * 5 = 30
7 * 5 = 35
8 * 5 = 40
9 * 5 = 45
10 * 5 = 50
```

**Notes:**
- You can use `\n` in string to jump to the next line
- Newlines should be added between rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end
- If you're unsure about the format, look at the sample tests

## Question 3: Differences from Average

Given a starting list/array of data, it could make some statistical sense to know how much each value differs from the average.

If for example during a week of work you have collected 55, 95, 62, 36, 48 contacts for your business, it might be interesting to know the total (296), the average (59.2), but also how much you moved away from the average each single day.

**Example:**

On the first day you did something less than the said average (55, meaning -4.2 compared to the average), much more in the second day (95, 35.8 more than the average and so on).

The resulting list/array of differences starting from `[55, 95, 62, 36, 48]` is thus `[-4.2, 35.8, 2.8, -23.2, -11.2]`.

**Requirements:**
- Assuming you will only get valid inputs (i.e., only arrays/lists with numbers)
- Create a function to do that, rounding each difference to the second decimal digit
